We are learining git hub:
to push code to git hub for the 1st time:
	1>create repo in git hub
	2>open git bash at the targeted folder
	2.5>touch .gitignore    --to mention files that need to be ignored at the time of pushing 
	3>git init
		--it will create a .git file in the folder that is hidden ,we can manually delete this file to remove relation 
		  with github repo.
	4>git add .
	5>git commit -m "Initial commit"
	6>git status      ---just to check status
	7>If don't configure ssh key,then generate one and configure it in git hub
	8>git remote add origin <ssh url.git>
	9>git push origin master

pushing to git hub in existing repo:
	0>git status --check the status
	1>git add . --make sure git is already initialize there
	2>git commit -m "New_comment"
	3>git push origin master

pulling from git hub:
	open git bash go to the folder where you want to perform pull request
	1>git init --initialize git
	2>git pull <ssh address of the repo available at code section>
